ProTrack

Author: Kirk Wallace

Use to track the amount of hours you work on different jobs.

Intended for users to log hours spent doing certain activities. It allows users to create "jobs" with unique names and descriptions of goals to be accomplished.Once a job is created the user can log hours by clicking on the title of the job and then adding a time entry using the "plus_sign" in the action bar. The time entries are editable from any stage at this point, which allows users to edit the time they work either in real time or at the end of the day.

Eventually this app will have a log-in for users. This will be used to separate and link employers with employees. Employers will then be able to see what hours the employees linked to their account have. Also it will allow them to see the description of the tasks they have done. It will hopefully be a stand alone human resources system for small businesses to utilize.
